Examples for the supercell Gamma-only CP-based Koopmans code


- example01 (bulk Si)

In this example a non self-consistent KI calculation on 
bulk silicon is showed. Maximally localized Wannier functions
are used as a guess for the variational orbitals. The 
interpolated band structure is finally calculated using a
python-based post-processing tool.
