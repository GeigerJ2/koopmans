Example01 (KI band structure of bulk Si)

- PW scf and nscf calculation to get the PBE ground 
  state and the KS states for the occupied and empty
  states

- Wannier90 calculation to obtain maximally localized
  Wannier functions for occupied and empty states
  independently.

- KI-trial calculation using a trial alpha ~0.077

- KI-fixed orbital-dependent calculation to get the
  optimal screening paramters

- KI-final is the final KI calculation
